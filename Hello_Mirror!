def hello_mirror():
  print(input('Type Hello World: ')[::-1])
  
# In one line this little program asks for input, takes the input and uses a slicing technique
# to return the string in reverse, and prints it.
#
#Remember, taking a string (we'll call it stng in this example) and slicing it allows us to
#access the individual letters. if stng = 'Hello' then stng[0] = 'H', stng[1] = 'e'  etc...
#and to get the very last character, no matter how long the string may be, use stng[-1]
#
#Slicing can do more, however.  You can choose a range of characters.  stng[0:3] returns 'Hell'
#
#Adding a third index to the string allows you to step through the characters
#stng[0:4:2] returns 'Hlo'.  So using -1 for that last index makes the string step BACKWARDS...
